You are developing a software system for a coffee shop. The system needs to handle different types of coffee beverages and provide the flexibility to add additional ingredients or modifiers to these beverages dynamically. 
For example, customers should be able to order a basic coffee like Espresso and then add extra shots of espresso, flavored syrups, whipped cream, etc., as per their preference.
